The primary objective of the UniConnect system is to create an integrated university 
management platform that optimizes attendance tracking, academic material access, and 
student-teacher interactions. The goals of UniConnect include: 
1. Enhanced Accessibility: Create a user-friendly platform where students, teachers, 
and administrators can access, manage, and update academic data as needed. 
2. Comprehensive Academic Resource Hub: Provide a centralized portal for study 
materials, including previous years' question papers, lecture notes, and curated 
YouTube course videos. 
3. Engagement & Collaboration Tools: Facilitate community building through chat 
features and interactive dashboards for students. 
4. Automated Attendance Tracking: Implement a system using IoT devices that 
enables real-time attendance recording without manual intervention (is not yet 
implemented as for yet cause of some limitations*). 
Scope of the Project 
UniConnectâ€™s features are designed to support the following user roles: 
1. Student: Access their dashboard to view attendance records, submitted and 
pending assignments, study materials, and participate in community chat forums. 
2. Teacher: Track class attendance, assign coursework to student batches, and 
monitor assignment submissions. 
3. Admin: Manage university timetables, create student batches, upload study 
materials, and oversee the overall usage of the system. 
Functional Areas: 
Academic Materials Access: Students have direct access to study resources, while 
administrators and teachers can upload and manage content. 
Assignments: Teachers can assign, review, and track assignment submissions 
through a structured portal. 
Community Engagement: Enables peer-to-peer and teacher-student 
communication through a chat feature within the student dashboard. 
Attendance Management: Automated attendance captured through IoT devices, 
providing accurate records and reducing administrative workload (not-implemented)
